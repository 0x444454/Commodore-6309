# Commodore-6309 hardware

The PCB has been designed by Gary Becker (thanks !).  
Note that the current PCB v0.8 is __intended for debugging purposes__ and requires soldering several jumpers and probe points that won't be in the final simplified version.

The PCB design is available on [PCBWay](https://www.pcbway.com/project/shareproject/Commodore_6309_A_new_CPU_for_the_Commodore_64_4cdcbc60.html). Again, please note that the current version is not a final product, is intended for hardware debugging, and comes with absolutely no warranty.

The PCB is derived from the one Gary designed for the [liber809](https://github.com/boisy/liber809) project targeting Atari 8-bit computers. Kudos to Boisy Pitre for the great support !
